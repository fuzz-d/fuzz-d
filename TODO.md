## TODO

- instrumenting Dafny
- swarm testing
- further type system expansion, sequence slicing
- ask Ally about hotspot testing??
- ensure we can't generate statements that reduce to `while (false)`
- further unit testing
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- parallel assignment to arrays via ```forall```
- continue + break support in loops
- Inner scopes using outer scope variable names (interesting case with arrays :) )
