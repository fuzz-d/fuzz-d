## TODO

- instrumenting Dafny
- swarm testing
- further type system expansion, sequence slicing
- parallel assignment to arrays via ```forall```
- continue + break support in loops
- Inner scopes using outer scope variable names (interesting case with arrays :) )
- Code quality: Unify symbol table implementations
