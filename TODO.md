## TODO
    
- [ ] Test case reduction workflow
- [x] instrumenting Dafny
- [ ] OOP integration
- [ ] proper checksum
- [ ] further unit testing
- [ ] parameter support in functions & function methods for data structures
- [ ] Sequences, sets, multisets, maps
- [ ] Multi-dimensional arrays
- [ ] parallel assignment to arrays via ```forall```
- [ ] continue + break support in loops
- [ ] Inner scopes using outer scope variable names (interesting case with arrays :) )
- [x] Updating values in array on assignment
- [x] Tracking values over if statements (control flow)
- [x] Expression safety for integer/real/character overflow
- [x] Assignment for non-array identifiers (should be a lot easier :) )
- [x] Logging
- [x] investigate other core types e.g. nat?
- [x] Basic while loops
- [x] ~~function methods~~
- [x] ~~functions - avoid recursion -- track method calls structure -- ensure returns have value~~
