## TODO
    
- Test case reduction workflow
- instrumenting Dafny
- checksum within control flow?
- Better internal object field use representation 
- ~~avoid reading uninitialised method return values~~
- ~~avoid array constructors as parameters~~
- reduce number of declarations + increase number of assigns
- ~~solve stack overflow errors - inner class generation limits~~
- ~~OOP integration~~
    - ~~Class method + field calls~~
    - ~~Class Instantiation AST expression~~
    - ~~Trait & class extension tracking~~
    - ~~Trait generation with extends~~
    - ~~Class & Trait AST definitions~~
    - ~~Class & Trait Generation~~
- ensure we can't generate statements that reduce to `while (false)`
- further unit testing
- parameter support in functions & function methods for data structures
- Sequences, sets, multisets, maps
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- parallel assignment to arrays via ```forall```
- continue + break support in loops
- Inner scopes using outer scope variable names (interesting case with arrays :) )
- ~~Updating values in array on assignment~~
- Tracking values over if statements (control flow)
- ~~Expression safety for integer/real/character overflow~~
- ~~Assignment for non-array identifiers (should be a lot easier :) )~~
- ~~Logging~~
- ~~investigate other core types e.g. nat?~~
- ~~Basic while loops~~
- ~~function methods~~
- ~~functions - avoid recursion -- track method calls structure -- ensure returns have value~~
